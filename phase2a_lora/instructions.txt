Upload the fall_detection algorithm to the Bangle's FLASH or install it as an app.

Once code is running on the Bangle, switch back to your Desktop and upload the lora_transmitter.ino onto the Arduino.
The file may have to be modified with your Bangle's unique MAC address. Once uploaded, the program will connect 
to the Bangle, read its sensor data and publish it via LoRa.

On a separate system that receives the data, run the lora_receiver.ino file and view it on Serial Monitor.
