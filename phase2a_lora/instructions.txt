Upload the fall_detection algorithm to the Bangle's FLASH or install it as an app.

Once code is running on the Bangle, switch back to your Desktop and upload the ble_transmitter_v2.ino onto the Arduino BLE.
The file may have to be modified with your Bangle's unique MAC address. Once uploaded, the program will connect 
to the Bangle, read its sensor data and print a string to Serial1.

Next, upload the lora_transmitter_v2.ino onto an Arduino Nano. This sketch sets up the env data sensors and receives the Serial string from the Arduino BLE.
The BLE's biometric data string is combined with the Nano's env data readings into one LoRa packet that is transmitted via the LoRa module.

On a separate system that receives the data, run the lora_receiver.ino file and view it on Serial Monitor.
